        This is my Portfolio. The website you're viewing is made through usage of the web developing languages known as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I barely know how to make a website, but hopefully this website turns out quite well. Anyways, let's move on to the next section of my website.

                I am a little familiar with operating systems, I have done quite some OS installs over the time, most of the time they were Windows.
                I have only tried out a few Linux Distributions, for example - 
                Cent OS, Zorin OS, Elementary OS and Linux Mint as well. I am currently trying to learn lots of programming languages at once which is proving to be quite a bit of a difficult task for me. I am much more familiar with hardware-related things like CPUs, GPUs and new tech in the market.

                I like to code, read books and basically just research about mythology, I love reading about Greek, Roman, Norse and Indian mythlogies. My favourite subjects are Maths and Science.

                I have worked on quite a few things, like websites (I totally haven't made only one decent website) and also I have created a game called Cubethon using
                 Brack's tutorial series. The links are as follows to my projects - <br>
